### Dashboard

The dashboard is the central space of the app. Quickly view the basic stuff. Check things that you should focus on currently.

#### Quick thoughts

- Utilize a calendar to promote consistency and planning
- Use graphs, charts, and other visual motivators

### Habits

You can set up habits - positive ones that you want to build and negative ones that you want to fix. We'll ask how is it going every time you log in. See the progress that you're making. Step by step you can achieve a lot. The little but consistent steps are the ones that matter the most!

#### Quick thoughts

- If you don't log in someday, we'll skip this day. It's up to you to track your progress. The app doesn't want to build up the FOMO.
- Encourage the user by highlighting how the small steps sum up.
- You can assign tasks and goals to habits to see how much you've done already for the sake of change!

### Goals

These are the big things you'd like to achieve in the future. You can create them here and assign an additional prize for completion.

#### Quick thoughts

- Celebrate the completion of the goal with the user. Remind him that it's a big thing.
- Remember - deadlines are stupid. It should be only an option to set one. Moreover, it should be discouraged.

### Tasks

Create simple action items that you'd like to complete soon. These can be a part of the bigger picture or just a small one-off. Keep the list of all stuff but mark the ones working on now.

#### Quick thoughts

- T-shirt sizing (XS, S, M, L, XL) will keep it simple. It's also correlated to the reward for the task (1, 2, 3, 5, 8).
- There'll be an enforced limit of stuff you're working on currently. Doing everything at the same time isn't good.
- Don't overforce the user into thinking they must do something.

### Notes

Keep quick thoughts managed in the same place as your other stuff. You can quickly convert your note into a habit, goal, task, or reward.

#### Quick thoughts

- Random notes tend to turn into a mess. There should be some way to overcome it.
- Notes shouldn't have anything more than a title and richly formatted content.

### Rewards

Completing tasks, achieving your goals, and keeping up with your habits lets you collect points. Spent them on rewards that you created for yourself. It's meaningful to prize yourself for doing a good job!

#### Quick thoughts

- Notifications on the progress to reward can be engaging.
- It's up to the user how he wants to reward himself.
- A lot of gamification power is here.

## Other ideas

- The ability to quickly search across various stuff in the app seems powerful. Full-text search (maybe a fuzzy one) should be doable.
- Adding comments to tasks/goals/habits can be convenient. However, it also can be too much. It's the most vital point to keep the app simple yet powerful.
- The app will be opinionated. It's one of the influences behind the thinking process.
- Anything is better than nothing!
